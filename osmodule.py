#The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system.
# OS comes under Pythonâ€™s standard utility modules.
# This module provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality.
# The *os* and *os.path* modules include many functions to interact with the file system.

# dictionary is similar to hash or map in python

#In Python, an anonymous function is a
# function that is defined without a name.
# While normal functions are defined using the def keyword in Python,
# anonymous functions are defined using the lambda keyword.
# Hence, anonymous functions are also called lambda functions.

#Recursion
#Python also accepts function recursion, which means a defined function can call itself.

#Recursion is a common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself. This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result.

#The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. However, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.

#In this example, tri_recursion() is a function that we have defined to call itself ("recurse"). We use the k variable as the data, which decrements (-1) every time we recurse. The recursion ends when the condition is not greater than 0 (i.e. when it is 0).

#To a new developer it can take some time to work out how exactly this works, best way to find out is by testing and modifying it.
